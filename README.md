The provided code is a Terraform configuration written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) for deploying infrastructure resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here is a summary of the code:

1. The code defines two AWS providers, one for the "us-east-1" region and another with the alias "us-east-2" for the "us-east-2" region.
2. Two variables are defined: "keypair" for an SSH keypair name and "my_ip_address" for the user's IP address.
3. Two VPCs are created, one in each region, with specified CIDR blocks.
4. Internet gateways are created and associated with the respective VPCs.
5. Subnets are created in each VPC with specified CIDR blocks and availability zones.
6. Route tables are created and associated with the respective VPCs.
7. Routes to the internet gateways are added to the route tables.
8. Load balancers are created in each region with specified configurations.
9. Security groups are created for instances and load balancers, defining inbound and outbound rules.
10. Target groups and target group attachments are created for load balancers in each region.
11. Listeners and listener rules are created for load balancers, specifying routing conditions and actions.
12. Elastic IP addresses and associations are created for instances in each region.
13. An EC2 instance is launched in the "us-east-1" region with specified configurations, including instance type, AMI, subnet, key pair, and user data.


This code is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and is used to manage DNS records in Amazon Route 53 for failover routing of traffic between two Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in different AWS regions. Let's go through the code section by section:

13. Data Block for ELB Hosted Zone ID:
   - This block fetches the hosted zone ID for ELBs in two different regions: "us-east-1" and "us-east-2".
   - The `data` block is used to retrieve information from AWS without creating any resources.

14. Resource Blocks for Route53 Records:
   - Two resource blocks are defined to create Route53 records for failover routing.
   - The first resource block (`aws_route53_record.primary`) represents the primary record.
     - It sets the provider to AWS, specifies the zone ID and domain name using variables.
     - The type is set to "A" (IPv4 address).
     - The `failover_routing_policy` specifies that this is the primary record.
     - The `set_identifier` is set to "primary" to differentiate it from the secondary record.
     - The `health_check_id` points to the health check resource for the primary ELB.
     - The `alias` block specifies the ELB's DNS name and zone ID as the target for this record.
   - The second resource block (`aws_route53_record.secondary`) represents the secondary record.
     - It uses the provider for the "us-east-2" region.
     - The configuration is similar to the primary record, except that it sets the `failover_routing_policy` to "SECONDARY" and uses the health check resource for the secondary ELB.
     - The `alias` block specifies the DNS name and zone ID of the secondary ELB.

15. Resource Blocks for Route53 Health Checks:
   - Two resource blocks are defined to create health checks for the primary and secondary ELBs.
   - The first resource block (`aws_route53_health_check.sreuniversity_check_primary`) sets the provider to AWS, specifies the IP address of the primary Elastic IP (EIP), port, type, resource path, failure threshold, and request interval.
   - The second resource block (`aws_route53_health_check.sreuniversity_check_secondary`) uses the provider for the "us-east-2" region and specifies the IP address of the secondary EIP and the rest of the health check configurations.

16. Output Blocks:
   - Two output blocks are defined to display the public IP addresses of the two Elastic IPs (`aws_eip.eip1` and `aws_eip.eip2`).

The code overall sets up Route53 records for failover routing between the primary and secondary ELBs. It uses health checks to determine the availability of the ELBs and directs traffic to the appropriate ELB based on the health check results.
The code sets up a basic infrastructure configuration with VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, route tables, load balancers, security groups, and EC2 instances in two AWS regions (us-east-1 and us-east-2).
